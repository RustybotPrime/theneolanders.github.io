        <h1>We are the Neolanders.</h1>
        <h3 style="color: lightgrey;">And this is our story...</h3>
        <br>
        <p>There once was a game called <span class="AL">Anyland</span>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At first glance, it didn't look like much, the graphics weren't pretty, and the UI layout was... questionable. But I assure you it was special. If you could get past the rough edges you discovered something truly special, a creative platform like no other, even to this day, one where every player was truly unique, their avatars, worlds, items, all built with their own two hands in-game. It could bring out the creative spirit in anyone who gave it an honest chance, but there was a problem, it was small, and limited, and falling into disrepair.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We needed a change...</p>
        <br>
        <p>A few of us were aware of <span class="Neos">NeosVR</span>, but none of us really gave it the chance it deserved, nobody until <span style="color: lime;">SloppyMcFloppy</span>. He came to us saying, <span  style="color: lime;">"I've found our successor to Anyland, it has in-game creation, advanced scripting, and an active development team."</span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span style="color: deepskyblue;">"Preposterous."</span> We thought. <span style="color: deepskyblue;">"Nothing could replace Anyland, this game has importing and it is nowhere near as accessible."</span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span style="color: lime;">"I know."</span> He said. <span style="color: lime;">"But hear me out, we could make this platform our own, we can do things differently, we can show them how the anylanders create."</span></p>
        <br>
        <p>So we gave it a chance...</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Something New</h3>
        <br>
        <p><span style="color: #ff5500;">Rustybot</span> was the second to get into it, and he immediately felt at home, every way Anyland limited him was no longer present, it truly felt like he could do <em>anything.</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>As more followed we slowly learned the ins and outs of the game, and a few of us discovered that we had an aptitude for 3D modeling software, that great things could be done when we don't limit ourselves to things we can do entirely within the game.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Eventually the Anylanders were becoming skilled within their own creative niches, and people began to notice us.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i style="color: lightgrey;">"Have you seen the Anylanders?"</i></p>
        <p><i style="color: lightgrey;">"They're so creative."</i></p>
        <p><i style="color: lightgrey;">"I have never seen anything like it before."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Alongside the people seeing something entirely new, there were a few players of this game seeing something familiar. More people who saw the true potential of this game, we were doing what they have been trying to tell the rest of the playerbase was possible for years. Those like-minded creators eventually joining our ranks.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We had casually used the label "Neolanders" for a while but as our group consisted less of Anylanders and more of creators from a variety of sources, it took on a new meaning. Neolanders wasn't just a catchy concatination of "NeosVR" and "Anylanders", it was a label of a growing group of creatives. The "New-Landers", travelling to new lands and bringing our creative forces with us. This double meaning of our name came in handy here. especially with what would come next...</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Moving, Again</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Due to a miriad of problems with the management of NeosVR, it stopped recieving updates. "Will our new home repeat the fate of our old." We worried, but little did most of us know, that Rustybot. one of our own, and for most intents and purposes our leader, had gained enough notoriety within the community to test something the developers were working on in secret.</p>
        <p>This project was of course <span class="Resonite">Resonite</span>, a reworked and rebranded version of NeosVR, this was wonderful news, but there was one issue, our name. What happens to the Neo-landers when we have left our namesake? As you can see, we decided no change was needed, that we have long owned our name and made it mean so much more.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And to our surprise we were approached by a member of the Resonite team, with an offer to use our diverse and creative likeness for marketing material for the game. It's up there right now, on <a href="https://www.resonite.com">Resonite.com</a> but we realized we didn't have anywhere to credit our involvement, which is why this site was created.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>And that's the story so far, but far from the end.</h3>
